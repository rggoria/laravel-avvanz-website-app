            The principles of data protection
        </p>
        <p>
            The Legislation stipulates that anyone processing personal data must comply with six data protection principles of good practice. These Principles are legally enforceable. 
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bolder">
            The Principles are: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Lawfulness: this principle is about having a good justification for collecting and using personal data; 
            </li>
            <li>
                Fairness: data collected must be relevant with the purpose of the processing; 
            </li>
            <li>
                Transparency: data subject must be informed and the data processed in a transparent manner; 
            </li>
            <li>
                Purpose Limitation: data must only be collected where there is a legitimate purpose for processing and not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with the original purposes;

                Data Minimisation: the type and scope of the processed data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose; 
            </li>
            <li>
                Accuracy: data must be accurate and where possible kept up to date; 
            </li>
            <li>
                Storage Limitation: data may be stored no longer than necessary for the specified purposes; 
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrity and Confidentiality: this principle is about keeping personal data secure, not just from unauthorized access but from accidental damage or deletion;
            </li>
            <li>
                Accountability: besides complying with the Legislation, it is necessary to demonstrate compliance.
