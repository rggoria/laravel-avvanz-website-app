        Education refers to the process where knowledge is being passed over from one individual (an instructor) to another – this means qualified instructors are required for effective learning outcomes regardless of their age or gender etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Does it then make sense if anyone fulfilling these requirements should automatically qualify themselves and become employable candidates offered jobs in educational institutions? Teachers are more than just decision makers when it comes to education. They’re the backbone of any school, and their ability to teach is what determines a success or failure in the classroom environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, employers have an obligation to make sure that they hire quality people with all-around credentials who can provide students with high-level skill sets for them to use as adults. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The criteria for a good teacher might sound straightforward, but the quality of education is dependent on how we hire teachers. When deciding between sending their children to school, parents usually look for educational efficiency; and this educational efficiency is determined by the teachers it hires.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most important considerations in recruiting teachers is their effectiveness. But what makes an effective teacher? It’s not just about having all the degrees and achievements; it means delivering well within a classroom setting, which can’t be proven during interviews alone. This has been demonstrated by empirical research conducted by Aaronson et al., as well as Rivkin et al.; both studies indicate that easily observable attributes such as degree or years of experience don’t always correlate to good teaching performance once we take into account more subjective measures like student learning growth scores. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So when considering your next hire for your school district, remember: you want someone who will have high-caliber classroom knowledge while also being dynamic enough to work with students on interpersonal skills development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are some ways to beef up your teacher hiring strategy:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ask questions about academic degrees, teacher certifications and work history so that they can determine the right fit for the school. We  also want to get an idea as to why teaching is important enough for them to pursue it at this stage in life 
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask something from past or present experience with kids that made them realize how much better teachers would be. Asking candidates about past classroom experience is one way to get insight into future potentials and behaviors as educators will be held accountable for both student academic outcomes and learning experiences outside of class time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pedagogy topics, such as understanding student backgrounds and expectations for lesson plans while also selecting appropriate teaching methods that will be most effective with the class. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Probe how candidates assign homework so their students feel challenged but not overwhelmed by completing a task outside of school hours. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Research their progress over the years through securing feedback from students, parents or teachers (depending on what is relevant). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Conduct rigorous background checks that encompass criminality, sexual offenses, fraud, behavioral issues or abuse.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Teachers are a special breed of people, and schools want to know more than just what they bring in terms of qualifications. Effective teacher hiring practices allow us to make the right choices for our respective institutions.
