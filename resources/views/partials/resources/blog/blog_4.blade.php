        Hiring remote employees is not an easy thing. It requires a different mindset and willingness to go outside your comfort zone. One of them is to be willing and able to invest in them so that they can become an integral part of the team in the long term.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hiring process is becoming ever more complex. With the pandemic, it has become even tougher to find and hire top talent for your company – a job that was traditionally done in person at an office or headquarter building. But now with so many employees working remotely from home during this time of crisis, you need to focus on which needs are most important-the safety and security of both your workforce and the business.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to recent stats, almost 80% of employees have been working from home during the pandemic. This has led to increased risks in the workforce, with safety, security compliance and fraud all risk factors. And while these risks come along with some blind spots which need to be taken into serious consideration; addressing them will mean the difference between facing serious consequences in future times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are things we need to heavily consider when hiring remotely:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Running a business presents many risks, from security breaches to potential data leaks. Home equipment often poses a risk to confidential data and, as such, it may not meet your minimum asset standard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Verifying identities can be more difficult when you can’t see someone face to face.
        </li>
        <li>
            When a new employee is onboarded, it’s important to know what’s going on in their home so that it doesn’t pose a cybersecurity risk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remote employees can also interact with their family members or friends without realizing that they are sharing sensitive and personal information.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For remote employees, it may seem that working with them is quite different than you may have with staff who were right there on site all day every day from the very beginning. But you will be surprised that there are many similarities. This is where thorough background checks become crucial to establishing a sense of peace of mind. Background checks are the most cost-effective and efficient method for ensuring that the applicants you select have a clean record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conducting a background check on potential employees is the key to ensuring that remote workers are trustworthy and reliable as well.
