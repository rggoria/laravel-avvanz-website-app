        Most organizations have implemented an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)and/or HRMS (Human Resources Management System) to streamline and automate HR processes that include recruitment, onboarding, training, payroll, leave management and performance management.

                They prove to be time-saving, increase efficiency, improve candidate experience, help make better hiring decisions, aid in compliance with local and national regulations such as data privacy laws and anti-discrimination laws and of course provide data-driven decision-making that can help inform recruiting and HR strategies and identify areas for improvement. As a result, ATS and/or HRMS are essential tools for modern HR and recruiting operations.

        Background Screening
    </h4>
    <p>
        An extremely crucial component that often miss in most HRMSs is Background Screening, given that it is a laborious process that can’t be easily undertaken inhouse and most HRMS providers can’t easily build it as a capability. Hence it makes perfect sense for them to integrate with leading background screening providers and it helps if the providers’ platforms are completely tech-based.

    <p>
        Integrating background screening with an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or Human Resources Management System (HRMS) offers the following benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Help streamline the hiring process and ensure that all applicants are properly screened to mitigate any risks due to wrongful hires.
        </li>
        <li>
            Employers can quickly and easily order background checks and access background check results, allowing them to make informed decisions about potential hires.
        </li>
        <li>
            Help employers save time and money by eliminating the need to manually enter and manage background check data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Candidate’s data can be pre-filled and this eradicates the need to fill up multiple documents (many time, can be duplicate documents) and this kills the new employee onboarding experience.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In a nutshell, this integration will enhance not just the HR but the Candidate experience too.

        Avvanz <a href="https://www.avvanz.com" class="link-hover">https://www.avvanz.com</a> has integrated (through MERGE) with several leading ATS and/or HRMS providers namely BambooHR, SAP SuccessFactors, Workday and Oracle Taleo.
    </p>
    <p>
        For these ATS/HRMS to integrate with Background Screening platforms like Avvanz ScreenGlobal (multi-award winning platform that provides more than 20 types of checks across 150+ countries), the platform must possess the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reputable and compliant to the local and national regulations
        </li>
        <li>
            Comprehensive background check services <a href="https://www.avvanz.com/background-checks/" class="link-hover">https://www.avvanz.com/background-checks/</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure data compatibility so that the data can be transferred between the Screening platform and ATS/HRMS
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine screening requirements by role or function.
        </li>
        <li>
            Establish workflows for each stage of the screening process from initiating the background check to reviewing and evaluating the results. This will help ensure that the process is efficient and that all relevant parties are involved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Train HR and Talent Acquisition personnel on the use of the integrated system
        </li>
    </ul>
