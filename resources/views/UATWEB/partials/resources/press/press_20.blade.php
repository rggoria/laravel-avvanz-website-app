    <p>
        Avvanz Managing Director, Kannan Chettiar explained that the Digital Transformation course would be beneficial to the accounting and finance community. He commented, “We are excited about this partnership. We will ensure that the workshops will allow a deeper understanding of Digital Transformation and complex technologies and allow the participants to apply their knowledge to their workplace as they embark on digital transformation journey for themselves and their companies.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Avvanz’s KYC/AML services, Background Checks and Company Due Diligence would be of high value to the ACCA members as well should they wish to run due diligence checks on companies they are auditing.
