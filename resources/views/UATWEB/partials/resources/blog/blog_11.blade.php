        Interviewing candidates is important to find the best fit for your company. However, interviews are not always enough to make sure that you have found the right person. There are many more factors involved in assessing a candidate’s fit and personality. Below, we will discuss the signs that may indicate if a candidate is bullshitting during an interview or assessment process!
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically, red flags are signs that point you toward hidden issues or flaws of a person. They emerge during the hiring process and can show up at any time. Sometimes they might be blatantly obvious in candidates’ social media profiles or resumes. At other times, red flags need to be identified through thorough interviews and personality testing before any conclusions about their suitability for hire can be made.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bolder">
        Work History:
    </p>
    <p>
        Employers need an accurate idea of what a candidate is capable of, which is why we always ask candidates about the trajectory they’ve had at previous jobs. The best predictor for how people behave in the future is by looking at past behavior – so if someone’s never been able to stick with one job before or leaves without notice it should raise some red flags! That said, there are plenty of reasons that could lead somebody out; maybe they felt like the position wasn’t going anywhere but wanted something different. Or perhaps circumstances changed within the company that made them feel as though continuing was futile. In the end we want our employees to stay committed till the very end and digging deep into work history issues warrants a second look.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bolder">
        Long Gaps in Employment
    </p>
    <p>
        Gaps in employment can be a red flag. Your candidates might have trouble holding jobs due to performance or personality issues if there are unexplained and unexplainable gaps between positions. The most common reasons are tending to family or personal matters, recurring emergencies or having to relocate due to more drastic reasons.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bolder">
        Leaving because of Disagreements
    </p>
    <p>
        Candidates who have a history of leaving companies because they don’t agree with their managers or company directives tend to carry this behavior into future roles. This can be an indicator that the candidate is unable to deal with conflict and lacks empathy in addition to other important character traits required for success at work such as social resiliency, both which are important character traits in any workplace environment.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bolder">
        Changing career path
    </p>
    <p>
        Analyze the candidate’s resume to determine if they have a history of changing career paths. This could mean that they get bored easily and will not be as engaged in your company’s routines or tasks once they may get used to them. It may also be an indication of bad performance and not being able to keep up on the job–hence changing lanes ever so often is always a preferred and convenient option just to hold a regular job.
    </p>
    <p class="fw-bolder">
        Unable to provide specific work Examples
    </p>
    <p>
        Candidates are often unprepared for the type of interview questions that they will receive in a technical or behavioral interview, and this can lead to some major concerns. For example, if someone is applying for an IT position but has never worked as one before then there may be some confusion when answering more specific types of follow-up questions regarding their experience with certain computer programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        While interviews can be an excellent way to get insight into the personality of a candidate, it is important not to rely on them too heavily. There are many other factors that need to come together in order for your company’s culture and values to mesh with those of the person you hire. It pays off when employers conduct thorough assessments during the hiring process. And because you want to make sure you’re hiring the right candidate, comprehensive employment <a href="{{ route('screen-sub-2') }}" class="link-hover">background checks</a> are one of many tools available for employers who want to avoid having any negative outcomes due to employee dishonesty or bad hires that can otherwise be overlooked in the interview process.
