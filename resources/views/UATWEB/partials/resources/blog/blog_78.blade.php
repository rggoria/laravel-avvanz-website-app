        What You Can Expect from Free Background Checks
    </p>
    <p>
        When learning <span class="fw-bolder">how to run a background verification check on someone for free</span>, it’s important to set realistic expectations. Free tools often provide limited information compared to paid services. Here’s what you can expect:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Basic Criminal Records:
            </span> You may find limited access to criminal records depending on the region and country.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Employment and Education Verification:
            </span> Public records rarely include employment history. You’ll likely have to rely on LinkedIn or other professional networks to confirm these details.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="fw-bolder">
                Incomplete Financial Data:
